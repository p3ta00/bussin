Bussin.sh

Bussin.sh is a Bash script for Linux (tested on Kali) that automates the download, installation, and updating of various tools. Whether the tool is a standalone binary (downloaded from a GitHub release) or a Git repository, this script makes it easy to manage your tools with a single command.
Features

    Download Tools:
    Easily download a binary from a GitHub release or clone a Git repository to a specified relative directory.

    Configuration Management:
    Every time you add a tool using the -d flag, the toolâ€™s details are stored in a configuration file (tools_list.conf) located in the same directory as Bussin.sh.

    Install & Update:
    Run the script with -install to install all tools listed in the configuration file, or with -update to update all tools (using git pull for repositories or re-downloading binaries).

    Relative Directory Storage:
    All destination paths are interpreted relative to the directory where you run the script, ensuring consistency regardless of your absolute path.

Installation

    Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bussin.git
cd bussin

Make the Script Executable:

    chmod +x bussin.sh

Usage
Add a New Tool

Use the -d flag to download a new tool and add it to the configuration.

./bussin.sh -d <destination_directory> <URL> [optional_tool_name]

    destination_directory: A path relative to your current working directory (e.g., linux/enumeration/linpeas).
    URL:
        For binaries, use the URL to the GitHub release asset.
        For Git repositories, use the repository URL (ending in .git).
    optional_tool_name: (Optional) Specify a name for the tool; if omitted, the script derives it from the URL.

Example:

Download a binary tool:

./bussin.sh -d linux/enumeration/linpeas https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/releases/download/20250301-c97fb02a/linpeas.sh

Download a Git repository (e.g., pypykatz):

./bussin.sh -d linux/enumeration/pypykatz https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz.git

After running the above commands, the tool details are saved in tools_list.conf in the same directory as Bussin.sh.
Install All Tools

Install all tools that are stored in the configuration file.

./bussin.sh -install

Update All Tools

Update all tools listed in the configuration file. For Git repositories, the script runs git pull; for binaries, it re-downloads the latest release asset.

./bussin.sh -update

Configuration File

Bussin.sh uses a configuration file named tools_list.conf (located in the same directory as the script) to store the tools you add. Each line in this file follows the format:

tool_name|relative_destination|tool_type|URL

    tool_name: The name of the tool.
    relative_destination: The destination path (relative to your working directory).
    tool_type: Either binary or git.
    URL: The download or repository URL.

You can manually edit this file if needed, but it's recommended to use the -d flag to add tools automatically.
